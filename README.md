# Portofolio Template

This is a free to use template that I made when I was bored. Feel free to use it, modify it & share it how you like. The idea of this portofolio is to give developers with no experience in webdev a base template that they can modify and create a solid portofolio for their projects.

`Note` that I am not a profesional web developer and this portofolio was made with bare minimum knowledge and chat gpt
information.
